# Project 1 breakdown
## Exercise 1
Write own code for OLS for polynomials up to fifth order
+ Using matrix inversion
+ Using SVD

Find the confidence intervals of the estimators, computing variance, MSE and R2

The code has to include scaling for the data (explain why)

Split data into train test - *PRESNT CRITICAL DISUSSION ON SCALING!*
